## Running the app (server)

### 1. Clone this repo

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/antoineNourZaf/TWEBProject.git
```

### 2. Install project dependencies
Open a terminal in the Server repository and run

```sh
$ npm install
```
### 3. Run the server

You can start the server by running
```$
$ npm start
```

or you can start the server in development mode. This command uses [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to watch changes in your code and automatically restart the server.
```sh
$ npm run dev
```
You can run the frontEnd by the same way but don't forget to change the directory
